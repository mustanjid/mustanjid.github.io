A **Software Engineer** by profession, with a passion for _research_ and _analytics_. I have experience building scalable web applications in a highly collaborative, cross-functional Agile (Scrum) environment.

To feed my research heart, I am currently integrating **computer science** with a variety of interdisciplinary fields such as **machine learning**, **bioinformatics**, and **systems biology**. My primary goal is to identify meaningful patterns and develop knowledge in this age of **big data**.

## Introduction
---
Hello! I'm **Md Al Mustanjid**, the creator of this blog project, which I address as **Mustanjid's Basket**. I built this project to provide a modern, easy-to-use template for building blogs using Astro, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. This project is inspired by the [Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) and aims to offer similar features with a different implementation.

ðŸ”— **[Live Website](https://mustanjid.github.io/)**

## Why This Blog?
---

This is where I document my journey in software development, including:
- Experiments
- Lessons learned
- Small projects
- Debugging struggles and solutions

Think of it as a **basket of knowledge**â€”full of messy code, "why is this broken?!" moments, and occasional victories. **Let's grow as we go.** ðŸš€

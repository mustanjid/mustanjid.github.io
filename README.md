## Introduction

Hello! I'm [Your Name], the creator of this Tailwind Astro Starter Project. I built this project to provide a modern, easy-to-use template for building blogs using Astro, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. This project is inspired by the [Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) and aims to offer similar features with a different implementation.

## Why This Blog

I created this blog template to help developers quickly set up a blog with modern web technologies. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this template provides a solid foundation for building a blog with features like MDX support, multiple authors, tags, and more.

## Tech Stack

- **Astro:** A modern static site generator.
- **TypeScript:** For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **MDX:** Combines Markdown with JSX for writing content.

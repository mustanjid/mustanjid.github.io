## Introduction

Hello! I'm Md Al Mustanjid, the creator of this blog Project, which I address as **Mustanjid's Basket**. I built this project to provide a modern, easy-to-use template for building blogs using Astro, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript. This project is inspired by the [Tailwind Next.js Starter Blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog) and aims to offer similar features with a different implementation.

## Why This Blog

This is where I scribble down thoughts, experiments, and half-baked projects while navigating the wild world of software development. Think of it as a basket from the trenches—full of messy code, “why is this broken?!” moments, and occasional victories. If you’re here, let’s geek out about the process, not just the polished results.
**Let’s grow as we go.**

## Tech Stack

- **Astro:** A modern static site generator.
- **TypeScript:** For type safety and better developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **MDX:** Combines Markdown with JSX for writing content.

## Features

- Astro with TypeScript
- Astro MDX support
- Easy styling customization with Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-friendly view
- Light and dark theme
- Automatic image optimization via Astro image component
- Support for tags and multiple authors
- Related posts and pagination
- SEO features like RSS feed and sitemaps
